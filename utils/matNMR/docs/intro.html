<p><b>Why another processing package ?</b><br>
Anyone who has ever done NMR has had the problem at some point or another that a problem has occurred
during an experiment and that that dataset was corrupted because of that. Now what do you do when
you are using a commercial processing package ? Very simple: you redo the experiment because 
the processing software does not allow you to do what has to be done.<br>
The need for flexibility is therefore one of the reasons matNMR has been written. Another reason is
that you never get nice pictures when you use a commercial program, because you always want something
that just isn't supported by the program. What do you do ?<br>
Yet again matNMR offers a solution by using Matlab's vast set of graphics routines ...
<br><br>
MatNMR is more than a static program that can be used only for processing data. It offers a wide
variety of commonly-used processing techniques for 1D and 2D spectra and combines these with the powerful
graphical and numerical possibilities of MATLAB. Basically the concept of matNMR is that the user can
do what ever he likes at any time. So without ever losing the capabilities that MATLAB has to offer or crashing matNMR.<br>
Only minor knowledge of Matlab is required to operate matNMR, although to be most efficient, good knowledge of
Matlab is naturally very helpful. <br>
If you want to use your own functions, change plots manually, manipulate matrices while still having all
matNMR windows opened, that's also fine!<br>
Because the most important word when talking about matNMR is: <font size="+2"><b>Flexibility</b></font>.
<br><br>
<font size="+3">Here is just a selection of what is supported in version 2.5 and higher :</font>

<dl>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> MatNMR is completely GUI!</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Full processing capacilities for 1D and 2D spectra (real, TPPI, STATES, (whole) echo)</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Several filters to read in data from various types of spectrometers</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Semi-automatic and manual Baseline corrections for 1D and 2D spectra</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Two types of linear prediction for 1D and 2D spectra</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Shearing transformation for 2D spectra in time and frequency domain</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Symmetrizing of 2D spectra</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Peak picking in 2D spectra</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Peak Fitting of (arrays of) 1D spectra</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> T1 Fitting (arbitrary exponential functions)</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> A wide variety of functions for creating (multiple) 2D contour, 3D mesh plots, stack plots and raster plots</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Drop-down menus for easy manipulating of plots</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Easy printing of plots</dd>
</dl>

<br><br>
<font size="+3">And what about this :</font>
<dl>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinred.gif" ALT="pinred"> A Processing history is recorded during processing</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinred.gif" ALT="pinred"> Full reprocessing capabilities from the processing history</dd>
</dl>

<br><br>
<font size="+3">This means:</font>
<dl>
<dd>No need to save large spectra on disk,</dd>
<dd>No need to keep track of processing parameters in lab journals.</dd>
<dd>Just connect the processing history to the FID and save this to disk, for later use.</dd>
<dd>Reload the FID from disk and reprocess to regain the same spectrum again!</dd>
</dl>

<br><br>
<font size="+3">Last but not least :</font>
<dl>
<dd>If there is anything that needs to be added quickly: <font size="+1">IT CAN BE DONE<img SRC="pics/excl2.gif" ALT="exclamation"></font><br></dd>
<dd>And that is where matNMR beats any commercial package<br></dd>
</dl>
