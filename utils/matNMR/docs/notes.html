3.2.0 (September 22 2004):</i></b></center>

<dl>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Offline processing has been added to matNMR. Most processing actions can now
be called from user-defined scripts, thus removing the necessity of using the graphical user interface (GUI).
Alternatively, processing macros can now be called from user-defined scripts, while running the matNMR GUI.
See Chapter 8, <a href="Offline.html#Intro">"Offline Processing with matNMR"</a>, for more details.</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Plotting macros have finally been introduced. Previously only processing actions
could be stored in macros, but now either one or both can be stored simutaneously in all windows. See
paragraph 4.4, <a href="Processing.html#Macros">"Using macro's"</a>, for more details.</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Macro recording and execution has been thoroughly rechecked (still no waranty though!).</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Limited support for 3D matrices has been added to matNMR. Series of 2D matrices 
(e.g. simulations) can be stored as a 3D and be processed efficiently using processing macros. See paragraph 
4.2, <a href="Processing.html#1D2DMode">"1D, 2D and 3D mode"</a>, for more details.</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> When working with the default axis, an external spectral reference may be
read into matNMR, to facilitate processing (see paragraph 5.2.5, <a href="MainWindow.html#Ruler_Xaxis">
Ruler_Xaxis</a> of the manual for more details).</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Context menus have been introduced to facilitate access to all processing functions, especially
with the altered menu layout (see paragraphs 5.2, <a href="MainWindow.html#Menubar">Menubar</a> and
6.3, <a href="2D3DViewer.html#Menubar">Menubar</a>. of the manual for more details).</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Subplot functionality in the 2D/3D viewer has been substantially enhanced,
with more layouts and improved support through plotting of 3D matrices into the available subplots. See
paragraph xxxx for more details.</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> <img SRC="pics/exclaim.gif" ALT="exclamation"> NOTE ON MATLAB 7.0: Currently matNMR does not work 
properly in Matlab 7.0. Even though this version 3.2.0 contains a number of bug fixes to solve most issues, there 
are differences in layout which cause certain windows to look distorted. This problem will be looked into as soon 
as I have access to Matlab 7.0 myself, or somebody is able to help me deal with these issues. Sorry for the inconvenience. </dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> A new plot type was added to the main window: errorbar plot. This allows the
typical errorbar plot, after assigning a variable with standard deviations. This is also supported in dual
display mode. See paragraph 5.2.5, <a href="MainWindow.html#PlotManipulations">
PlotManipulations</a> of the manual for more details.</dd>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> A presistent problem has hopefully been solved: in certain parts of the code a conjugate transpose
had been used instead of a real transpose. This could cause problems in some routines (e.g. linear prediction).</dd>

2.7 (August 2001):</i></b></center>

<dl>
<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> An undo function has (finally) been added and the number
of steps that may be undone can be specified in the "general options" menu. This very useful
function should be used with care for 2D processing though since the full (hypercomplex) 
spectrum is stored in memory for each step.</dd>

<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> States-TPPI processing is supported.</dd>

<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Solvent deconvolution as was proposed by Marion, Ikura and
Bax a long time ago, has been implemented.</dd>

<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Proper input formats for both MacNMR and NTNMR have been
added. The previous restriction for the MacNMR has thus been removed (see previous release).</dd>

<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> More functionality has been added to the 2D/3D Viewer:
more subplot configurations, two new colormaps, two new plotting routines: 2D bar plot and
a polar plotting routine. Furthermore the colorbar may be made printable in MIF format!</dd>

<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> An attempt has been made to make the output created with
matNMR more WYSIWYG. Unfortunately this still doesn't work flawlessly due to some problems
with MATLAB.</dd>

<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> An import filter for MacNMR binary data (TecMag) has
been added. Currently there is still the restriction that the file must be transfered
from the Macintosh to a PC or a UNIX machine first. (I still don't know how the header
looks like if you read the file directly on the Macintosh .... sorry!)</dd>

<img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> There is an online manual <img SRC="pics/exclaim.gif" ALT="exclamation"></dd>

<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Improved graphics performance in the 2D/3D Viewer: several rendering steps are avoided. Before
the figure window was selected actively and causes additional rendering by MATLAB. Note however that another slow step, selecting a 
new axis in the 2D/3D Viewer window still exists. This is exactly one of those painful rendering steps. And this one cannot
be avoided. (Actually, it could be avoided but then one cannot see what is the active axis anymore)<br>
This does mean that the fancy clock for the mouse pointer is no longer shown while plotting!</dd>

<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> The "shifting gaussian" and "shifting gaussian (echo)" apodization routines have been changed such
that they are better suited for processing echo- and anti-echo spectra.</dd>

<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> A new feature "Cut Spectrum" has been added to the 2D/3D Viewer menu. It can be used to slice up 
high-resolution spectra such that one only sees the peaks of all slices in the plot. An unlimited number of slices can be defined
for both dimensions. The number of slices in each dimension do not have to be equal. Peak picking and other functions are still
fully functional after doing this.</dd>

<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Non-linear axes vectors can also be handled by the "Get Position" and "Extract 2D" routines
in the 2D/3D Viewer.</dd>

<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> Axis vectors can also be specified directly in the input window for both 1D and 2D
FID's/Spectra in the main window.</dd>

<dd><img SRC="pics/pinblue.gif" ALT="pinblue"> The list of fonts that matNMR knows can be specified from the options menu in the main window.</dd>
