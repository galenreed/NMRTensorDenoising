Known bugs/Ideas for matNMR 3.3 for MATLAB v5.2 and above :

Feature wish list:
==================
- Starting processing states spectra is done rather silly now: one first has to go into the
	2D processing menubar and then select "start states processing". This is not very
	good I feel.

- The "get position"-routine in the main window (crsshair.m) is able to recognize all lines in
	the current plot. And when there are multiple lines then it allows switching the crosshair
	between the lines. However this does not work when the axis vectors are not equal! So lines
	of unequal length create problems. This could be changed though....

- More file formats could be supported to import into matNMR. Ask around!

- Do we need more export filters?

- dual display currently allows changing of the display mode to real, imaginary, both, absolute
	and power spectrum. For hypercomplex matrices this doesn't work correctly in case the
	imaginary part is needed since the checkinputdual routine doesn't read in the hypercomplex
	parts of the second matrix. Is this worth spending time on?

- Currently the reading of standard parameter files is still quite limited. One easy thing to
	improve things would be to read in all spectral frequencies into the matNMR structure
	and allow the user to choose which frequency to couple to which dimension. Would this
	be used though?

- Making a projection in the 2D/3D viewer window of a spectrum that was plotted as a pcolor surface
	produces an error. The default pcolor routine reduces the matrix size by 1, hence matNMR
        avoids that and increases the matrix artificially by 1. The projections routine uses the
        elongated axis, but the original matrix to generate the projection, hence the error.

- Using the <enter> key doesn't work in input windows. This is true when the pointer is on a uicontrol
	in the input window. It does work when the pointer is somewhere in the window where there are
        no uicontrols. This is unfortunately necessary because Matlab doesn't evaluate and update the 
        string and value of a uicontrol until the pointer is taken off.

- When processing 3D datasets the history is not kept properly. Whenever changing between indices in the
	third dimension, the history from the FID is reloaded. Only the processing history is stored from the
        last index to be dealt with.

- dual display of a vertical stack plot in the main window does not take the axis direction into account,
	meaning half of the time the overlayed spectrum will be in the wrong direction. I need to define
	how the routine should deal with overlayed spectra and their axes.


Weird and/or MATLAB-related errors:
===================================
- When printing to EPS using the matprint routine Matlab can freeze. It will use 100% 
	CPU and not finish the printing. The postscript file is partly finished. It is unclear
	whether other drivers show the same behaviour. A crash dump file is written upon
	freezing stating a segmentation violation. I'll ask mathworks about this ...
	Mathworks claims that this is because I'm using an X-server which is newer than the
	one they support, which is 6 years old. Great ....
	NOTE: This only occurs when I work in 24 bit mode while using the "painters" rendering
	mode for printing. When I switch to 8 bit mode or "zbuffer" the problem doesn't appear.

- The Extract2D.m is used for extracting for parts of a 2D spectrum. After having specified
	the region of interest with the MATLAB function rbbox, an input window is opened
	to confirm the selected coordinates (because of rounding errors I ask for a
	confirmation). For some weird reason MATLAB always throws this input window into
	the background. HIGHLY ANNOYING.
